# Reksio-Launcher
 Launcher for the mainline Przygody Reksia/Aventurile lui Reksio games
 
 Currently, the repo contains source files and binaries for the Polish and Romanian versions only
 
 To use, create a directory with six subdirectories containing the files of the six games respectively, and name each subdirectory after the game itself for the Romanian version (Reksio si Comoara Piratilor, etc.) or after the game's initials for the Polish version (RiC, etc.), then put the binary in the main directory and run it
 The games will still prompt the user to insert a disc when selected unless a no-CD patch is applied to each
